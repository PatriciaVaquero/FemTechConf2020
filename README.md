# :pushpin: FemTechConf2020

In this repository you will find all the materials for the topic: _How to apply Ensemble methods as ML Algorithms?_ of the talk I gave at FemTechConf2020! :blush: 

MATERIAL OF THIS REPOSITORY :point_down:

- The Power Point Presentation.
- The Jupyter Notebook used for the session.
- The record of the talk.

:point_right: **Ensemble Methods** use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone.
